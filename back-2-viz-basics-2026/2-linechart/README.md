# 📈 Week 2 - Build a Line Chart

Link: <https://data.world/back2vizbasics/2026week-2/workspace/project-summary>

**Challenge:** For Week 2 of 2026, we’re focusing on another essential foundational chart: Line charts. Line charts are ideal for showing how values change over time, helping us see the overall direction of the data and how it evolves.

**Data:** This week, we’re looking at profit per passenger for some of the largest US airlines to show the impact of COVID-19 on airline profits. Our data fields are:

- *Year:* The reporting year from 2015 to 2024. Note that 2020 is not included.
- *Airline:* The name of the Airline.
- *Profit per Passenger (USD):* How much profit or loss an airline makes for each passenger it carries, calculated by dividing total net income by the number of passengers flown.

**For those newer to #B2VB:** Focus on the basics of a clear line chart. Be selective about which points you label to avoid clutter. Consider how you can visually separate overcrowded lines by emphasising individual lines.

**For more experienced users:** How can you use annotations or emphasis to clearly show the drop in profit during COVID and the pace of recovery that follows?
