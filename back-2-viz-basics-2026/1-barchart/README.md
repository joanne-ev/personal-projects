## Description

For Week 1 of 2026, we would like you to build a bar chart.

## Summary

**Challenge:** For Week 1 of 2026, we are returning to the most essential foundational visualization: the Bar Chart. Bar charts are the gold standard for comparison because they leverage our natural ability to perceive differences in length, making complex rankings intuitive at a single glance.

**Data:** This week, we are diving into the WEF Youth Pulse 2026 report. The World Economic Forum surveyed Global Shapers to understand which economic shifts will define their future. The data reveals a clear split between concerns over stability and the rise of new, flexible ways of working. Our data fields are:

- *Economic Trend:* The specific trend identified
- *Trend Sentiment:* Whether the trend is categorized as Negative or Positive
- *Selection %:* The percentage of respondents who selected this as a top-three trend

**For those newer to #B2VB:** Focus on the basics of a great bar chart. Sort your bars from largest to smallest to show a clear ranking. Ensure your labels are easy to read and your chart has a clear, descriptive title.

**For more experienced users:** Since this data contains both "Positive" and "Negative" sentiments, how can you use color or grouping to tell a deeper story about the outlook for 2026?
