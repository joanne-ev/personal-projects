# 🌏 Gross Domestic Product

Analyse how the gross domestic product (GDP) has evolved worldwide since the 1960s.

This dataset consists of the yearly gross domestic product (GDP) in current USD of countries and regions worldwide since the 1960s.

## Challenges

Challenges are brief tasks designed to help you practice specific skills:

- 🗺️ Explore: Try to identify recessions in different countries.
- 📊 Visualise: Create a plot to visualize the change in GDP in your country over the past decade.
- 🔎 Analyse: Which country had the highest percentage growth in GDP over the past decade?

## Scenarios

Scenarios are broader questions to help you develop an end-to-end project for your portfolio:

> You are have been hired by an NGO to learn about the economic development of countries in Central America: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.
>
> Using data from 1960 through to 2016, you have been asked to give a deep-dive on the GDP growth of each country per year and decade. Your manager is also interested in how each country compares to the regional average.
>
> You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
