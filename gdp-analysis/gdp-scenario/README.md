# Scenario 🌍

You are have been hired by an NGO to learn about the economic development of countries in Central America: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. 

Using data from 1960 through to 2016, you have been asked to give a deep-dive on the GDP growth of each country per year and decade. Your manager is also interested in how each country compares to the regional average.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It should outline your motivation, steps, findings, and conclusions.
